## I. Introduction
AI has become a normal part of education, especially in computer science and software engineering. Tools like code generators, debuggers, and explanation models are now easily accessible and can significantly change how students learn and build software. In a course like ICS 314, where a lot of the work involves frameworks, tooling, and real-world development patterns, AI naturally fits into the workflow.
Throughout ICS 314, I primarily used ChatGPT as my main AI tool. I have also experimented with GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini’s NotebookLM in other courses, but ChatGPT was the most useful and consistent for this class. I used AI for many different tasks, including writing and debugging code, learning unfamiliar frameworks, understanding concepts from different perspectives, and improving writing quality. Overall, AI acted less like a replacement for learning and more like a productivity and understanding booster when used correctly.

## II. Personal Experience with AI in ICS 314
Experience WODs (e.g., E18)
For Experience WODs, I used AI occasionally, mainly when I got stuck and didn’t know how to start. For example, during a Functional Programming WOD, I asked ChatGPT:
“Write a framework function to implement the following instructions: ”
This was useful because it gave me a starting point and helped me see how the logic might be structured. However, the generated solution was often not exactly what the WOD required, so I still had to adjust it and debug on my own. The main benefit here was breaking through mental blocks, while the downside was that it sometimes took trial and error to get something fully correct.

### In-class Practice WODs
I liked using AI during in-class Practice WODs mainly to save time, especially when dealing frameworks and basics. For example, I would ask:
“Create a basic React page layout with Bootstrap that meets these requirements.”
This allowed me to focus more on understanding how the framework worked instead of spending time on repetitive setup steps. The tradeoff is that it can reduce hands-on exposure to setup details, but for practice WODs, I think the time savings were worth it.

### In-class WODs
I used AI in almost every in-class WOD, mostly because of time pressure. I often asked ChatGPT to:
“Create a framework that satisfies all of these WOD requirements.”
 “Check if this code meets all the rubric requirements.”
This helped ensure I didn’t miss small but important requirements. However, the frameworks AI generated were sometimes overcomplicated or slightly off, so I always had to review and modify the output. AI was extremely helpful here, but only when combined with careful checking and testing.

### Essays
For essays, I mainly used AI for grammar, clarity, and flow, not for generating ideas or content. A typical prompt I used was:
“Edit this paragraph to improve grammar, clarity, and flow.”
This helped clean up my writing and made my arguments easier to follow while still keeping my own ideas and voice. I found this to be one of the lowest-risk and most consistently useful uses of AI.

### Final Project
I used AI heavily during the final project, especially when working with tools I wasn’t fully familiar with, such as Vercel, Prisma, and deployment-related workflows. Examples of prompts I used include:
“How does deployment work with Vercel?”
 “Why is my Prisma migration failing and what is this Vercel error?”
AI was extremely helpful for understanding tooling and speeding up development. However, this was also where hallucinations were most noticeable, so I always double-checked answers against official documentation. AI was best used here as a guide, not a source of truth.

### Learning a Concept or Tutorial
Sometimes I just need another perspective for something to click. In those cases, I asked questions like:
“Explain functional programming assuming I already know JavaScript.”
 “Explain this concept with a concrete example.”
Being able to rephrase explanations on demand was very helpful, especially when experiences or documentation explanations didn’t fully land. The downside is that it’s easy to rely too much on explanations instead of experimenting, so I tried to balance both.

### Answering a Question in Class or Discord
I never answered questions in class or on Discord using AI. If I was going to respond publicly, I felt it was important that the answer reflected my own understanding rather than something generated for me. That said, many of the issues discussed in Discord were problems I had encountered myself, and I often used AI privately to help work through them. Combined with my prior experience in software environments, this was still very helpful for resolving issues and reinforcing my understanding, even if I didn’t directly post the AI-assisted answers.

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question
I never asked or answered Smart Questions. However, I noticed that many Smart Question issues were problems I had already encountered and solved using AI. This showed me that many of these issues were solvable once the problem was phrased clearly, which is something AI is especially good at helping with if the user knew how to operate it.

### Coding Examples
When learning a new concept, I often used AI to generate simple examples. For instance:
“Give an example of using map in typescript”
This was useful because I could immediately see a working example and then modify it to better understand how it worked. The examples weren’t always perfect, but they were good learning tools.

### Explaining Code
This was one of the most useful ways I used AI. When dealing with confusing or poorly written code, I would ask:
“Explain what this code is doing step by step.”
This helped me understand the overall intent of the code before diving into specific lines. It made working with unfamiliar codebases much easier.

### Writing Code
AI was very helpful for generating baseline code, especially for things I already understood conceptually but didn’t want to write from scratch. For example:
“Write a basic layout for this dashboard page.”
This saved time, but I still needed to modify the code to fit project requirements and ensure it followed best practices.

### Documenting Code
AI-generated documentation was generally clear, but I often adjusted comments so they better reflected my own thought process. For example:
“Write comments for this code”
This sped up documentation while still allowing me to personalize it.

### Quality Assurance
I used AI frequently for debugging and fixing linting issues, such as:
“What’s wrong with this code?”
 “Fix the ESLint errors in this file.”
This was especially helpful when ESLint error messages weren’t very clear. The benefit was faster debugging, but I had to be careful not to blindly apply fixes without understanding them.

### Other Uses in ICS 314
There were no other significant uses beyond those listed.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Overall, AI had a positive impact on my learning experience. It made it easier to understand concepts, debug issues, and move through assignments efficiently. However, it definitely reduces the amount of mental effort required to solve problems, which can be harmful in the long run if relied on too heavily. Used correctly, AI enhances learning; used incorrectly, it replaces it.

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314
Outside ICS 314, I have used AI extensively in other projects, mainly for navigating documentation and unfamiliar libraries. It is especially useful for quickly finding relevant information, but it is critical to verify answers using official documentation to avoid hallucinations.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
One major challenge with AI is that without a basic understanding of a concept, it is very easy to miss mistakes in AI-generated output. This is especially dangerous for beginners. Because of this, I think it’s important to learn the fundamentals first and then use AI to build on top of that knowledge. This also creates an opportunity to teach students how to use AI responsibly and critically.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
AI-enhanced learning is far more engaging because it feels like having a tutor available at all times. Traditional teaching, however, still plays an important role. Knowledge retention depends more on how actively a student engages with material than on whether AI is used. For practical skill development, I think traditional teaching still has an advantage, since industry experts provide structured, experience-based guidance that AI cannot consistently replicate.

## VII. Future Considerations
Right now, AI is extremely useful for students who already understand the basics and want to cut out repetitive or boring work. For beginners, AI-assisted learning still needs improvement because it’s easy to be misled by incorrect outputs. That said, AI tools focused on education are improving quickly, and I expect this gap to shrink over time.

## VIII. Conclusion
In ICS 314, AI played a significant role in how I learned and completed work. It improved efficiency, helped clarify complex ideas, and supported both coding and writing tasks. At the same time, it reinforced the importance of having a strong foundation and thinking critically about AI-generated output. With thoughtful integration, AI can be a powerful tool in software engineering education without replacing the learning process itself.
