I tend to start a lot of new interests, whether they are different types of games or new sources of inspiration. Many of these fade away early on when I hit a roadblock and dont feel like im growing, but a few manage to take root and grow into something more meaningful. One of these is software engineering, which kept gaining momentum through YouTube, where I saw many creators combine imagination and programming to build exciting and entertaining projects. I look up to them, and they provide me with enough motivation to keep going so I can also make something I am proud of and feel a sense of accomplishment.

I don’t know exactly where this path will lead me, but right now I’m branching out and experimenting with a few different ideas. Each project or concept I try adds a little more to my foundational roots, even if some of them may not last long. The process of trying, overcoming the challenges, and learning still gives me the experience and motivation I need to keep moving upwards. 

This is only just the beginning, like a sprout pushing above the soil. With enough time, effort, and curiosity, I believe it can grow into something bigger that provides both fulfillment and new opportunities for adventure. But for now, I’m focused on nurturing that growth and seeing where it leads me in my own career and life.
